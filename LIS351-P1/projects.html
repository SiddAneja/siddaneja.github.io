            </dt>
            <dd>
                Over my time in college I have had the honor to work at two technology companies that are leading the charge in their respective fields.
                Both these times I worked as a Software Development Intern and had a great team of peers and mentors who taught me a lot of industry related 
                and life skills. If you would like to more more please feel to reach out on my socials!
